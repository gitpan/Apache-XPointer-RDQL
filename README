DESCRIPTION
    Apache::XPointer is a mod_perl handler to address XML fragments using
    the HTTP 1.1 *Range* header and the RDF Data Query Language (RDQL), as
    described in the paper : *A Semantic Web Resource Protocol: XPointer and
    HTTP*.

    Additionally, the handler may also be configured to recognize a
    conventional CGI parameter as a valid range identifier.

    If no 'range' property is found, then the original document is sent
    unaltered.

IMPORTANT
    This package is a base class and not expected to be invoked directly.
    Please use one of the RDQL parser-specific handlers instead.

SUPPORTED PARSERS
  RDFStore
    Consult Apache::XPointer::RDQL::RDFStore

MOD_PERL COMPATIBILITY
    This handler will work with both mod_perl 1.x and mod_perl 2.x; it works
    better in 1.x because it supports Apache::Request which does a better
    job of parsing CGI parameters.
